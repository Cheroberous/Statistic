## What is Statistics (1)
   Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data. 
   The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.
   Statistics has strong relationships with a wide range of disciplines, as it serves as a fundamental tool for data analysis and decision-making in various fields (from social sciences to business and industry).
   Some examples of data analysis in different fields: <br>
   - Financial analysts use statistical models for risk assessment, portfolio management, and predicting stock market trends.
   - Statistical analysis helps researchers in medical studies to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of medical interventions and treatment outcomes.
   - astronomers use estimates and mathematical theories to devise their best guess to just how far items in the universe are away from each other.
   - ad so on...

   ### Descriptive Statistics: <br>
   Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphs like histograms and scatterplots. Descriptive statistics provide a clear understanding of the data at hand, does not 
   incorporate the deduction part. <br>
   <br>
   ### Inferential Statistics: <br>
   Inferential statistics is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics helps 
   us draw conclusions and make decisions about populations using sample data. <br>

## Key Concepts (2)

- **Population**: the population is the entire group of individuals, items, or observations that you want to study. It can be large or small, depending on the research question.
* **Sample**: itâ€™s virtually impossible to measure a whole population completely because they tend to be extremely large. Consequently, researchers must measure a subset of the population for their study. These subsets are known as **samples**
+ **Attribute**: In data analysis or data mining, an attribute is a characteristic or feature that is measured for each observation (record) and can vary from one observation to another.
- **Variable**:  A population variable is a descriptive number or label associated with each member of a population.
* **Level of measurement**: there are 4 levels of measurement,
  + Nominal: the data can only be categorized
  + Ordinal: the data can be categorized and ranked
  + Interval: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced
  + Ratio: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero. <br>
*Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze your data may be limited.*
- **Dataset**: a dataset is a collection of data points, often organized into rows and columns, where each row represents an individual or observation, and each column represents a variable.

## Sampling Methods (3)
It would often not be possible to gather data from every data point within a population to gather statistical information. Statistics relies instead on different sampling techniques to create a representative subset of the population that's easier to analyze. There are several primary types of sampling in statistic:


- **Simple random sampling** calls for every member within the population to have an equal chance of being selected for analysis. The entire population is used as the basis for sampling, and any random generator based on chance can select the sample items. For example, 100 individuals are lined up and 10 are chosen at random.

- **Systematic sampling** calls for a random sample as well, but its technique is slightly modified to make it easier to conduct. A single random number is generated and individuals are then selected at a specified regular interval until the sample size is complete. For example, 100 individuals are lined up and numbered. The 7th individual is selected for the sample followed by every subsequent 9th individual until 10 sample items have been selected.

- **Stratified sampling** calls for more control over your sample. The population is divided into subgroups based on similar characteristics. Then you calculate how many people from each subgroup would represent the entire population. For example, 100 individuals are grouped by gender and race. Then a sample from each subgroup is taken in proportion to how representative that subgroup is of the population.

- **Cluster sampling** calls for subgroups as well, but each subgroup should be representative of the population. The entire subgroup is randomly selected instead of randomly selecting individuals within a subgroup.

- **Convenience Sampling** involves choosing individuals or items based on their ease of accessibility, which may not be truly random
  
## Experiment designs (4)

Experimental design is the branch of statistics that deals with the **design** and analysis **of experiments**,
practically is the design of any task that aims to describe and explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation.
Differents methods and techniques have been adapted in different fields: <br>

- **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**: Involves randomly assigning subjects to treatment and control groups to evaluate the effect of an intervention.
- **Factorial Design**: Examines the effects of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable by systematically manipulating these variables.
- **Cross-Sectional Study**: Collects data from a sample of subjects at a single point in time to study relationships or differences between variables.
- **Longitudinal Study**: Collects data from the same subjects over an extended period to track changes and trends over time.
- **Quasi-Experimental Design**: Similar to an RCT but lacks full randomization, often used in real-world settings where randomization is difficult.
