Homework 1


Theory (intro)
1) What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.
2) Describe the concepts of Population, Sample Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset.
3) Briefly describe the main sampling methods
4) Briefly describe the main experiment designs


1.1) Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data.
   The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.
   
1.2)
   Descriptive Statistics: 
   Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphs like histograms and scatterplots. Descriptive statistics provide a clear understanding of the data at hand, does not 
   incorporate the deduction part.
   Inferential Statistics:
   Inferential statistics is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics helps 
   us draw conclusions and make decisions about populations using sample data.
